# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on key factors such as location, size, and number of rooms. 
By analyzing historical housing data, we use machine learning to create a model that estimates property prices, 
helping buyers, sellers, and real estate investors make informed decisions.

## Why It Matters
Accurately predicting house prices allows for better financial planning, fair pricing, and improved decision-making in real estate.
Understanding which factors influence home prices the most can also help identify trends in the housing market.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: We preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and formatting data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We analyze relationships between features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) and house prices.
3. **Feature Engineering**: We select the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.
4. **Machine Learning Models**: We train and compare models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Evaluation**: We measure model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Key Findings
- House prices are strongly influenced by **location, size, and the number of rooms**.
- Advanced models like **Gradient Boosting** outperform simpler ones in predictive accuracy.
- Proper feature selection significantly improves model performance.
